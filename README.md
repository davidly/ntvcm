NT Virtual CP/M Machine. Emulates CP/M 2.2 and the 8080/Z80 on Windows to run .com files. 

This app emulates the subset of CP/M 2.2 required to run asm.com, load.com, and Turbo Pascal
versions 1.00 and 3.01A. The latter two use bdos APIs very differently.

Console input/output work for both bios bdos API. Disk input/output work via the bdos API.
There is no attempt at emulating physical disks; apps that use bdos will just work.

The x80 emulator passes at 100% for:
    
    8080: 8080ex1.com, 8080pre.com, Microcosm v1.0, and cputest.com V1.2 in 8080 mode.
    
    Z80: zexall.com, zexdoc.com, and cputest.com V1.2 in Z80 mode.
    
I implemented this to automate testing of apps generated by the BA BASIC compiler in my TTT repo,
so I wouldn't have to copy files to my TRS-80 Model 100 or Z80 CP/M 2.2 machines. It was just
as painful copying them to other emulators because those (that I found) can't be invoked with 
other Windows apps in a test script.

Performance of the CPU emulator is faster than the half-dozen other emulators I looked at. I
wrote the code to be more readable than other emulators, whose use of lookup tables and macros
I found to be nearly inscrutable. An interesting fact is that on modern CPUs, code for computing
parity of a byte is faster than a 256-element lookup table. The same applies for other tables.

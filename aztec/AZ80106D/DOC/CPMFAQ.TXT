=====================================================================

Q1: Does CP/M stand for anything?

A: (Don Kirkpatrick)

   There are at least three popular answers - Control Program for
   Microcomputers, Control Program for Microprocessors, and Control
   Program/Monitor.  The issue is clouded by authors of popular CP/M
   books giving different answers.  According to Gary Kildall (the
   author of CP/M), in response to a direct question on the PBS show
   "The Computer Chronicles" following Computer Bowl I, was: Control
   Program for Microcomputers.  This is also consistent with DRI
   documentation.  See, for example, p. 4 of the DRI TEX manual.


Q2: Is CP/M in the Public Domain?

A: (Jay Sage)

   CP/M is not in the public domain, and there is at least one source
   for the purchase of new, legal copies:

              David McGlone
              149 W. Hilliard Lane
              Eugene, OR 97404-3057,
              503-688-3563.

   On the other hand, there have been lots of greatly improved clones,
   including ZCPR3 for the command process and several replacements for
   the BDOS.  Those components can be obtained from oak.oakland.edu and
   from many BBSs.

  
Q3: Where are the CP/M archives?

A: (Don Maslin, Ralph Becker-Szendy, Paul Martin, Ulrich Hebecker)

   Simtel20 is no more.  Five sites that stock CP/M files are:

              oak.oakland.edu
              wuarchive.wustl.edu
              update.uu.se
              ftp.demon.co.uk
              reze-2.rz.rwth-aachen.de
   
   Assuming the availability of anonymous ftp, look into the
   subdirectories of oak.oakland.edu: /pub/cpm.  There is a *lot*
   there!  One of the first directories to check is starter-kit.  It
   contains everything you need to get up and running.


Q4: What languages/compilers/databases/editors are still available?

   had several dozen CP/M programs in the 1992 catalog.) It is the
   kind of programs which ought to be written in BASIC: Typing tutors,
   little engineering programs like calculation of the stiffness of
   beams, education math programs. Their address is:

Q5: What new CP/M computers are available?

A: (Ralph Becker-Szendy, John D. Baker)

   The YASBEC (uses a 64180, has  SCSI interface), written up in TCJ
   a while ago.

   The CPU280 (uses a Z280, an IDE interface is available), also
   written up in TCJ, circuit boards are available from Jay Sage and
   Ralph Becker-Szendy.

   Ampro Little Board products were available from Dean Davidge of
   Davidge Corporation, Buellton, CA, but he may have moved and the
   address and phone number are unknown.

   The Micromint SB180/SB180FX is also still available.


Q6: What is this I hear about a CP/M CD ROM?

A: (Jack Velte)

   The disk should be ready early in 1994.  It's going to be about
   full, probably over 600 Meg. It may contain some commodore 64 and
   128 files and some embedded system controller files, but mostly it
   will be CP/M.  So far it contains these files:

        fog/         First osborne user group newsletters and promo's
        fog_000/     First osborne user group intro to cpm
        t_hoot/      Tom Hoot personal collection
        tcj/         The Computer Journal collection
	znode/       The Newton Centre Z-Node, Z-Node #3, in Newton
                     Centre, Massachusetts.
	znode_12/    This software was collected over a period of
		     many years by Lee Bradley, Z- Node 12 Sysop.
		     There is about 20 megabytes here. Many files are
		     .LBR's which contain compressed members, so the
		     actual size of this collection is probably close
		     to 30-35 megabytes. No index is provided but the
		     three files -MYZ-001.DIR, -MYZ-002.DIR and
		     -MYZ-003.DIR give the file names and the
		     .LBR member names.
        zsus/        Z-System Software-Update-Service
        cpm/         From SIMTEL
        cpmug        From SIMTEL -- cpm user's group collection
        sigm         From SIMTEL -- sig m user's group collection

   The cost will be $39.95 plus $5 shipping and handling (per order,
   not per disk) for US/Canada, and $10 for airmail overseas.  If you
   live in California, please add sales tax.  For further information:

              (800)786-9907 


Q7: How can I transfer my CP/M files to DOS?

A: (Don Maslin, Will Rose, Alan Ogden)

   One solution is Sydex' excellent shareware program 22DISK which
   permits reading (and writing) many CP/M format disks on a PC.  It is
   available on:

         oak.oakland.edu: /pub/msdos/diskutil/22dsk140.zip

   There is also UniForm by Micro Solutions that should still be
   available from them. There are versions for both the IBM-pc's and a
   lot of different cp/m machines. Micro Solutions can be reached at:

              Micro Solutions
              123 W Lincoln Hwy.
              DeKalb, IL 60115
              (815)756-3411 Voice
              (815)756-2928 Fax
              (800)890-7227

   If it's for an IBM type system, talk to them about what kind of
   hardware/software you have. Some flavors of PC have a problem with
   both UniForm and 22disk and UniForm will not operate properly under
   DRDOS v6.0.  UniForm also fails if the machine clock exceeds
   ~20MHz.  This has been confirmed with Micro Solutions, and no fix is
   available.

   Remember these conversion programs only enables you to read on your
   PC what was stored on the disk when under CP/M.  They make no
   conversion of file content.


Q8: How can I convert an (insert name) disk to (insert name) format?

A: (Jay Sage, Curt Schroeder, Mike Gordillo, Don Kirkpatrick)

   David McGlone and Elliam Associates (see above) offer disk
   conversion services at modest prices that can convert from just
   about any format to just about any other format.

   If you have a Kaypro equipped with an Advent TurboROM, Plu*Perfect
   Systems offers a program called MULTICPY that can read/write about
   one hundred different 5 1/4 formats.

   It is not possible to directly read/write Apple II CP/M disks on any
   other host machine because an Apple disk is recorded in GCR which is
   incompatible with FM/MFM disk controllers.  The only way to get CP/M
   files in or out of Apple II CP/M disks is via a serial link with a
   non-Apple II host.

   There exists a program called "Juggler" for the C128's CP/M that
   will read/write 130 different CP/M formats both 3.5 and 5.25 MFM
   (and some GCR) formats.  Juggler is available from Herne Data
   Systems in Canada.  A demo version, and other C128 specific CP/M
   software, can be found at:

        ccosun.caltech.edu: /pub/rknop/INCOMING/CPM/juggdemo.lbr

   The demo accesses only 22 formats.  A location for the full 130
   format version is not known, so be on the lookout.


Q9: Can I run CP/M on my MSDOS machine?

A: (Juergen Weber, Udo Munk, Paul Martin, John D. Baker)

   Available by anonymous ftp from the primary mirror site
   OAK.Oakland.Edu and its mirrors:

        pub/msdos/emulators/zsim23.zip

   ZSIM is an (extremely accurate) Z80 emulator (80386/40 -8 MHz Z80)
   in conjunction with a CP/M 80 BIOS, i.e. it simulates a Z80 machine,
   that can run CP/M.  Together with the original CP/M operating system
   you have a full Z80-CP/M machine.

   If you don't have a CP/M system disk at hand, you can use the
   included public domain CP/M compatible operating system P2DOS.

   ZSIM uses CP/M format disks, a ram disk and a hard disk.  Supported
   disk formats are CP/M 86 single sided and double sided, but you can
   install any singled sided CP/M format PC drives can physically
   read.  So you can use ZSIM to transfer data to MS-Dos.  The ram disk
   can be saved to the PC hard disk.  The hard disk is in an MS-Dos
   file.  A sample hard disk containing the SMALL-C compiler is
   included.

   As ZSIM uses an original operating system and CP/M disks it should
   run every CP/M program that does not use special hardware.  ZSIM is
   free for personal use.  Sources of the CP/M BIOS are included.

   On raven.alaska.edu you'll find:

        /pub/coherent/sources32/z80pack.tar.Z.

   This is a Z80 CPU emulation completely written in C, an I/O
   emulation for a typical CP/M system also is included. The package
   also comes with the BIOS source for the I/O emulation and a Z80
   cross-assembler.  It was developed it under COHERENT but it's known
   that it does work under Linux and SunOS too. You still need a CP/M
   license to get CP/M running or you might try to get one of the free
   available CP/M clones running on it. On a 486/66 DX2 running
   COHERENT it's like a 11Mhz Z80 CPU, so the emulation speed is
   acceptable.

   On oak.oakland.edu you'll find:
 
        /pub/msdos/emulator/myz80111.zip
 
   MYZ80 is a Z80/64180 emulator package.  The new 80486, 80386 & 80286
   machines with the fast hard drives and the snazzy OS/2 operating
   systems are such a delight... but for many, the Z80 machines still
   have to be fired up from to time in order to develop code for CP/M
   and the Z80 chip. Well, not any more, thanks to MYZ80.
 
   Other emulators on the market are less than satisfactory solutions.
   Of the small number which can actually run without causing system
   errors under the later versions of DOS, apparently none is capable
   of running real CP/M. Instead they use an emulated version of CP/M
   which is only as accurate as the developers have bothered to make
   it.
 
   MYZ80 can run CP/M 3.0 and ZCPR (which is such a useful Z80
   developer's environment).  So if you suffer from less than perfect
   Z80 emulation and slow overall performance, give MYZ80 a try, and
   save the 'real' Z80  machines for those cold winter mornings when
+  you really need the heat.  The author of MYZ80, Simon Cran, can be
+  reached at:

|  It may also be helpful to note that Micro Solutions had a device
|  called the MatchPoint PC, which was effectively an Apple //e on a
|  card, for the IBM clones.  When used in conjunction with a
|  MicroSolutions CompatiCard, you can read files from an Apple CP/M
|  disk and transfer to another disk format with a special
|  configuration of UniForm.  That although this setup is effective, it
|  is quite expensive and the cost is not justified for small amounts
|  of copying.



Q10: Where can I get a boot disk for (insert system name)?
   
A: (Don Maslin)

   Getting a system disk is pretty easy - if Dina-SIG CP/M System Disk
   Archives has it.  However, some dialogue with the requester has
   usually been necessary to assure that we are talking about the same
   Jurassic inhabitant!  There are just too many variants in the CP/M
   world.  A request with specifics on the computer, an address to mail
   to, and some recompense is all it takes.  Since this is an unfunded
   effort on the part of the SIG, the costs of media, mailer, and
   postage  must be recouped.  In general, and there are variations,
   this runs $3 for the first disk and $2 or less for each additional.
   Eight inch disks are a bit more!  However, a swap can be arranged if
   the other party has disks that are not duplicative of ones already
   in the archive.  If you can help augment the archive, yours is
   free.

   The keeper of the archives can be reached at:

              Don Maslin
              7742 Via Capri
              La Jolla CA 92037
              619-454-7392

   or use the email address given above.


Q11: What terminal emulation programs are available?

A: (Peter A. Schuman)

   The leading CP/M public domain or freeware (author kept copyright
   but distributed it for free) modem programs are:

	MODEM740 - The last of the "MODEMxxx" programs.

	IMP245 - This is nice, and works smoothly within what it does.
	What it does, it does very well.  IF you have slow floppy
	drives, there is a patch to cut down the receive buffer size.

	MEX114 - different from the above two, but minimally functional
	with just an IMP overlay.  To use it all, you need MEX overlay
	for your machine.

	ZMP15  -  This program includes ZMODEM file transfers.

	KERMIT - This program may have the widest implementation base
	because it uses only printable characters for its file
	transfers.  This is a plus because the MODEM7 family of
	protocols send binary characters that sometimes conflict with
	the underlying system use.  It is a minus because many more
	characters must be sent and thus is slower.  KERMIT may be
 	found on watsun.cc.columbia.edu.

	QTERM43E - This is somewhat like using QMODEM on an MSDOS
	machine.  Qterm has VT100 emulation mode as well as XMODEM and
	KERMIT protocol.  If you can get (or write) a good overlay,
	this is a nice program.

   For high speed transfers, you will probably need interrupt-driven
   routines, which are available for some these.  The exact baud rate
   where it becomes necessary varies by system and program.


Q12: How do you unpack a .ARK or .ARC file?

A: (Gier Tjoerhom, Don Kirkpatrick)

    Archive files are a collection of related files packed together so
    they stay together.  They have somewhat been replaced by librarys,
    but are still encountered often.  The C or K at the end only
    differentiate the original packing program, they are otherwise
    identical.  Some archives are self extracting, just rename them
    with a .com ending and execute them.  Others must be unpacked with
    a program, unarc16.ark containing one of the most popular (in a
    self extracting archive). This archive can be found at:

         oak.oakland.edu: /pub2/cpm/arc-lbr/unarc16.ark


Q13: How do you unpack a .lbr file?

A: (William P. Maloney, Peter A. Schuman)

   A .lbr is a single file that contains a number of compressed files
   inside.  The files must be extracted from the .lbr before the can be
   used.

   One very good library extract program is called lbrext.com.  It's
   simple to use and uncrunches the files at the same time.  EXAMPLE:

        A>lbrext b:myfile.lbr c:*.* uo

   This takes the lbrext.com file on 'A' to extract all the files in
   myfile.lbr on 'B' and put them on 'C' uncrunched.  A simple 'lbrext'
   first will show you how to use the .com file.

   Other popular library maintenance programs are LUE, DELBR, and NULU,
   the latter being one of the best CP/M programs for handling LBRs.
   However, don't use NULU to extract and unsqueeze simultaneously.  It
   occasionally screws up doing this, and it can trash an entire disk
   when it does so.


Q14: What are all these .xQx, .xYx, and .xZx file types?

A: (Don Kirkpatrick)

   These are compressed files, a.k.a. squeezed or crunched files.  They
   must be uncompressed before they can be used.  They differ in the
   compression algorithm; .?Q? was the first generation and .?Y? the
   newest.  There are many fine programs that uncompress files, but
   most handle only one or two compression types (e.g. SQ111.ARC and
   CRUNCH24.LBR).  One program that will uncompress all three types can
   be found in CRLZH20.LBR.


Q15: Are any of these .ARK, .LBR, or CRUNCH utilities on MSDOS?

A: (Geir Tjoerhom)

   Yes, MSDOS versions do exist and can be located as follows:

        oak.oakland.edu: /pub/msdos/arcutil/lue220.zip         (.LBR)
        nic.switch.ch: /mirror/msdos/archiver/arce41a.zip      (.ARK)
        nic.funet.fi: /pub/msdos/packing/compress/alusq.com    (.xQx)
        nic.funet.fi: /pub/msdos/packing/compress/uncr233.zip  (.xZx)


Q16: Why does my Kaypro drop characters above (insert baud rate)?

A: (Jeff Wieland, Stephen Griswold, Don Kirkpatrick)

   The basic problem is that updating the screen takes too long and some
   incoming characters are missed.  The exact baud rate where
   characters begin to disappear depends on the configuration of the
   Kaypro and the terminal program.  Generally, the older non-graphic
   Kaypros will run at a much higher baud rate before characters start
   to disappear.  Stock Kaypros are not interrupt driven and the BIOS
   ROM has several built-in delays, which demanded too much of a
   2x/4x/10's time.

   Several things can be done to help the situation.  If your Kaypro
   came with the MITE software package, you can use it for high speed
   terminal emulation.  A Kaypro 2X using MITE can go as fast as 19200
   bps.  MITE uses interrupts to achieve this.

   Sometimes the problem can be ignored. A 2X will drop characters at
   300 baud using Kermit-80.  File transfers work fine at 19200 bps.
   It is always a good ides to run file transfers in the quiet mode if
   terminal mode is dropping characters as then the display update time
   is minimized.

   The graphic-equipped Kaypros can be significantly improved in
   terminal mode just by turning off the status line at the bottom of
   the screen.  As most terminal programs have an initialize sequence
   available, just send the no status line command to the Kaypro -
   <ESC>, C, 7 [1BH, 43H, 37H in hex].

   There are several hardware changes that can lessen or eliminate the
   problem.  There is a speed modification for the 1983 Kaypro-II's &
   IV's requiring changing some chips to faster versions and outfitting
   the back with a toggle switch.  Upgrading to a MicroCornucopia MAX-8
   or Advent TurboROM also helps.

   If your machine is equipped with the Advent TurboROM and you choose
   to run QTERM, Don Kirkpatrick can send you an interrupt driver that
   allows the graphic-enhanced Kaypros to work just fine to at least
   2400 baud.


Q17: What is an Advent TurboROM?

A: (Don Maslin)

   The Advent TurboROM is a firmware upgrade to the Kaypro.  It
   replaces the original Kaypro system ROM and provides flexible
   configurations, additional disk formats, greater speed, and bug
   fixes.  Contact point for this is:

Q18: How can I add a hard drive to my Kaypro?

A: (Don Kirkpatrick)

   Chuck Stafford (see above) sells hard drive conversion kits.
   Emerald Microware used to offer hard drive kits for the Kaypro, but
   has run out of hard disk controllers. If you already have your own
   WD-1002-05 or WD-1002-HDO or can find one, then Emerald can provide
   you with controller software.  They can be contacted at:

              EMERALD MICROWARE
              P.O. Box 1726
              Beaverton OR 97075
              503/641-8088  Brian/Patricia


Q19: What belongs in the unpopulated board area on a Kaypro?

A: (Don Maslin, Don Kirkpatrick, Peter A. Schuman)

   A clock and modem go there.  The modem is rather useless as it is
   only 300 baud.  The clock/calendar is useful.  The Computer Journal,
   issue 64, Nov./Dec. 1993, describes the installation procedure.
   There is also an area on a 2X for a hard drive interface.  



Q20: What is The Computer Journal?

A: (Kevin Spears, Don Kirkpatrick)

   The Computer Journal is a magazine specializing in CP/M, small
   systems, and related topics. Chuck Stafford writes a regular column
   on Kaypros and Jay Sage writes one on Z Systems. In their own
   words:

	"The Computer Journal has been supporting CP/M and Z80s for TEN
	years.  TCJ has recently increased our support by providing
	more beginner CP/M articles, as well as our regular advanced
	ZCPR column.  The ZCPR column is written by one of the ZCPR
	authors and guides people in replacing CP/M with this
	do-it-yourself operating system.

	Tired of PC/MSDOS files getting bigger and bigger?  Like to do
	things in a simple way?  How about learning about new devices
	without having the latest "C" compiler?  Have you been
	wondering about using the new IDE drives on your CP/M system?
	We do all that and more at The Computer Journal."

   There are six issues per year, and the subscription rate is $24 for
   1 year, or $44 for 2. Subscriptions may be sent to:

Q21: What is ZCPR and the Z System?

A: (Jay Sage, Don Kirkpatrick)

   The original ZCPR was written in Z80 code and was called the "Z80
   Command Processor Replacement".  It was a drop-in replacement for
   the Digital Research CCP (Console Command Processor) and adhered to
   the 800H space restriction.  ZCPR2 (February 14, 1983) was the first
   experiment in greatly extending the power of the command processor.
   It added additional memory modules for supporting such things as
   multiple commands on a line, a dynamically reconfigurable command
   search path, and directory names associated with drive/user areas.
   The ideas and implementation in ZCPR2 were only half-baked, and they
   came to logical fruition in ZCPR3 (Richard Conn's 3.0 and Jay Sage's
   3.3 and 3.4).
 
   ZCPR3 gives you UNIX-like flexibility.  Features implemented include
   shells, aliases, I/O redirection, flow control, named directories,
   search paths, custom menus, passwords, online help, and greater
   command flexibility.  ZCPR3 can be found on many BBS and SIMTEL
   mirrors.  The Z System commercial version is available for a nominal
   fee from Jay Sage.  Further details can be found in the text "ZCPR3,
   The Manual", by Richard Conn, ISBN 0-918432-59-6.
 
   You can find a detailed history of the development of ZCPR and the Z
   System in Jay Sage's column in issue #54 of The Computer Journal.
   This article celebrated the 10th anniversary of ZCPR, which was
   first released on February 2, 1982.  His "ZCPR33 User's Guide" also
   has a section on the history (it can be ordered from Jay for $10,
   domestic shipping included).


Q22: What ever happened to the Z800?

A: (Ralph Becker-Szendy, Frank Zsitvay)

   The Z800 was planned to be NMOS, and was finally implemented as the
   Z280 in CMOS, five years late.  And it does have a 4kB/8kB paged
   MMU, and separate I/D space, and cache. There are small differences
   between the Z800 preliminary spec and the final Z280 specification.

   The Z180 was not an outgrowth of the Z800.  It was a joint effort
   between Zilog and Hitachi.  The first two versions of the HD64180
   were slightly different from the current Z180.  The current HD64180
   and Z180 are identical, and both have flags in one of the control
   registers to emulate the earlier versions.  The changes are mostly
   bus timing, as the HD64180 was designed to interface with Motorola
   6800 style peripherals as well as Intel and Zilog, which wasn't too
   strange since Hitachi second sources some Motorola 6800 series
   products.


Q23: What is the status of the Z380?

A: (Ralph Becker-Szendy)

   The Z380 is a 32-bit version binary-compatible upgrade of the
   HD180.  The 18MHz part in the 100-pin QFP package is shipping.  The
   plan for a PGA-package for the Z380 has been scrapped.  Zilog is
   working on a 25MHz part, but it isn't quite ready yet.  The
   "Preliminary Product Specfication", Zilog part number DC6003-02,
   documents the part.  According to the manual, the plans include a
   40MHz part, but the time frame is uncertain.


Q24: What is the KC80?

A: (Ralph Becker-Szendy)

   There was an announcement in the trade press about a deal between
   Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Zilog. Kawasaki has developed
   something called the KC80, which is a Z80 (no MMU, extended address
   space, or 32-bit enhancements), but speeded up to execute most
   instructions in one or two cycles, and running at 20MHz.  Zilog has
   the rights to the design. The catch is that Zilog is currently not
   planning to sell it as a chip.


Q25: Anyone know a good source for cross assemblers?

A: (Roger Hanscom)

   There are a variety of sources for cross platform development tools.

   The C Users' Group (1601 W. 23rd St., Suite 200, Lawrence, KS
   66046-2700) has a library of software that includes all kinds of
   development tools.  Source code is distributed with many of them.
   They charge $4/disk and $3.50 s&h per order, and can supply 3.5" or
   5.25" DOS formats.  Those of you seeking assemblers or disassemblers
   will be particularly interested in volumes number 398, 363 (2
   disks), 348, 346 (2 disks), 338 (2 disks), 335 (4 disks), 316, 303,
   and 292(4 disks).  They also market a CD-ROM of volumes 100 through
   364 for $49.95 list (it can usually be found at computer shows for
   $25 to $35).  They can be reached at 913/841-1631 FAX: 913/841-2624.

   The Circuit Cellar BBS is on-line 24 hours per day with some cross
   development tools, particularly for CPU's that are commonly used as
   controllers.  They have a Courier HST running 2400/9600 bps at
   203/871-0549, and another line that will do up to 14.4k bps (8N1) at
   203/871-1988.  Both of these numbers are in Connecticut.

   The Motorola BBS is in Austin, Texas, on 512/440-3733.  They have
   downloadable cross development products mostly for the 68xx and
   68xxx architectures.  Like the Circuit Cellar BBS, this BBS seems to
   specialize in micro-controller development.  Many of these files can
   also be accessed over the network on bode.ee.ualberta.ca
   (129.128.16.96).

   Don't forget to look in the old familiar places, such as
   oak.oakland.edu and wuarchive.wustl.edu.

   It is an unverified rumor that Walnut Creek CDROM (cdrom.com) has
   some tools from some of the sources listed above on line on their
   server.

  SCRAMB'LER-128 High security disk/data encryption system for C-128 CP/M

Herne Data Systems Ltd. is pleased to announce the release of version 2.0 of
Scramb'ler-128.  Scramb'ler is a user transparent, high security disk
encryption system for the Commodore C-128 (in CP/M mode) which protects your
vital and confidential data from un-authorized access.  Scramb'ler uses a
specially created, encoded floppy disk format (compatible with the 1571 and
1581 drives, but NOT the 1541) with 4 to 24 character personal password based
data encryption.

With Scramb'ler, the entire disk is encrypted.  In fact, YOU CANNOT EVEN
DISPLAY A DISK DIRECTORY OR MAKE ANY SENSE OF A SECTOR EDITOR OUTPUT WITHOUT
KNOWING THE CORRECT PASSWORD.  Once Scramb'ler has been installed with your
correct password, any standard CP/M program, such as WordStar, dBase, MBASIC,
etc., can fully access the Scramb'led disks.  Without the correct password,
the Scramb'led disks are locked up tighter than the proverbial Fort Knox!

Scramb'ler is fully compatible with all versions of C-1228 CP/M and does not
interfere with normal (i.e. non-scramb'led) disk access.  SCRAMB'LER DOES NOT
WORK UNDER GENERIC CP/M BECAUSE IT RELIES ON HARDWARE FEATURES OF THE C-128.

The retail price of Scramb'ler is $19.95 US or $22.95 CDN.  For more
information, contact:

Herne Data Systems Ltd., PO Box 714, Stn C, Toronto, Ont., Canada, M6J 3S1.

FORMAT EXECUTIVE runs on the C128 in CP/M mode.  It is the most powerful file
conversion program ever written for Commodore computers.  It allows you to do
file transfers between over 150 3.5 and 5.25 disk formats. It supports MSDOS
to CP/M to CBM file conversions.  It can also be used to transfer files
to/from Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, and Apple Macintosh. All Commodore Drive
Devices are supported: (154x,157x,158x, 17xx RAMdisks). Will transfer any file
type: ASCII (text) or OBJECT (program) files. Supports wildcard type transfers
too for multiple file copying. Download fe-v40.inf and fe-fmts.txt for further
information. Check cat 17 in CP/M BB area for additional information also. Has
received rave reviews from everyone who has used it.  FE is the choice of many
of the SYSOPS on GEnie and QLink.  Available as follows: Send $59.95 plus
$3.50 S&H ($7.50 Foreign) COD add $3 to: Powersoft, Inc., P.O. Box 7333,
Bradenton, FL 34210. Contact POWERSOFT on GEnie or QLink.

QDisk from Herne Data Systems Ltd. of Toronto is a user transparent device
driver that allows the Quick Brown Box battery backed CMOS RAM cartridge to be
used as a non-volatile RAM disk on the C-128 in CP/M mode.

It works with all versions of C-128 CP/M and with all CP/M programs and
utilities by defining the QBB as a CP/M disk drive.  You get the speed 
  of a RAM disk with the security of not losing data when the power is 
switched off.  QDisk works with either the 32k byte QBB or the 64k QBB. With
the 64k size, the QBB can even be partitioned into separate 32k areas, one of
which can be used in C-128 native mode or C-64 mode.

QDisk is available for $9.95 (US) or $10.95 (CDN) plus $2.00 P&H from:

Does QDisk only work in CP/M mode?  It seems if they can use it for CP/M mode
it would be fairly easy to do the same in 128 or even 64 mode.

Dave: the QBB is supplied with RAM disk software for use in C-128/64 mode  . Q
Disk is a new program which allows it to be used in CP/M mode.

Can it be used in tandem with a 1700 or 1750 REU ???

carl: of course it can, but you will need a cartridge port expander. the QBB
can be assigned as drive B, C, or D (your choice) (the QBB itself is supplied
with RAMdisk software for C-64 and C-128 native modes)  See review in latest
INFO for more iinfo on QBB. miklos g.

Miklos, you mean I can have the REU as M:, AND QBB as C:, all working at the
same time?  Bill J.

bill: absolutely correct!! you can even partition the 64k qbb into two 32k
drives c: and d: it is interesting to note that the qbb drive appears to be
FASTER than the REU.  (The QBB drivers work entirely in Z80 mode, while the
REU does a round about method using the 8502.  both use a 'sector' size of 256
bytes so the added speed of the REU DMA is lost becuase of the obstruse code
used to access it. thus the QBB ends up being faster.) miklos g.

                    INTRODUCTION

MicroCalc is a tiny spread sheet program a la  VisiCalc. It  is
provided with the TURBO-Pascal system as an example program.

Since MicroCalc is only a demonstation program it has its limita-
tions (which you may have fun eliminating):

  * You cannot copy formulas from one cell to others.
  * You cannot insert and delete lines or columns.

In spite of its limitations MicroCalc does provide some interest-
ing features among which are:

  *  11 digits floating point reals (Thanks to TURBO Pascal!)
  *  Full set of mathematical functions (SIN,COS,LN,EXP etc.)
  *  Built in line editor for text and formula editing.
  *  Text  can  be  entered across cells.
  *  Once entered a formula is protected from accidental erasure.

In addition to this MicroCalc offers all the usual features of  a
spread sheet program:


  *  Load a spread sheet from the disk.
  *  Save a spread sheet on the disk.
  *  Automatic recalculation after each entry. (May be disabled).
  *  Print the spread sheet on the printer.
  *  Clear the current spread sheet.

The spread sheet is an electronic piece of paper on which you can
enter  text,  numbers and formulas and have MicroCalc do calcula-
tions automatically.

The next page shows the electronic spread sheet.

A 5  Formula:
(A1+A2+A3+A4+A5)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In  the example the next last line shows that the active cell  is
cell  A5  and that A5 contains  a  formula:  (A1+A2+A3+A4)  which
means  that  the numbers in A1,A2,A3 and A4 should be  added  and
placed in A5.

The formula can be abbreviated to: (A1>A4) meaning: add all cells
from A1 to A4.

You move the cursor around just like you do in the TURBO editor:

                             (Up)
                            Ctrl-E
                (Left) Ctrl-S     Ctrl-G (Right)
                            Ctrl-X
                            (Down)

A cell may contain a number, a formula or some text. The type of of the cell
and its coordinates are shown in the bottom left corner of the screen:

A 5   Formula:         (Means that the current cell is A5 and that it
                       contains a formula)

A 1   Text             (Cell A1 contains text)

A 2   Numeric          (Cell A2 contains a number and no cell references)

                     Summary of MicroCalc
     Cells are denoted A1 through G21 giving a total of 147 cells.

Summary of standard functions and operators:
SIN, COS, ARCT, ABS, FACT, EXP, LN, +,-,/,*
Futhermore the operator '>' can be used to denote a range of cells to add.

Entering data
To enter data in any field move the cursor to the cell and enter the
data. MicroCalc automatically determines if the field is numeric or a
a text field.


When moving between fields:
^S,^D,^E,^X move left right up and down.

When editing a field
^S,^D moves left and right. ^A,^F moves to beginning/end of line.
DEL,^G  deletes left or right character.
ESC makes it possible to regret changes and to edit an existing cell.

                     Summary of commands


    /   will restore the screen
    Q   will Quit MicroCalc
    L   will Load a spread sheet from the disk.
    S   will Save a spread sheet on the disk.
    R   will Recalculate
    P   will Print the spread sheet.
    F   makes it possible to change the output format for numbers.
    A   switches Autocalc ON and OFF

Note: to use scientific notation use the the F command and enter minus one
      -1 for the number of decimals.

                              EXAMPLES

The following are examples of valid cell formulas:

A1+(B2-C7)  subtract cell C7 from B2 and add the result to cell A1
(A1>A23)    the sum of cells:  A1,A2,A3..A23
(A1>B5)     the sum of cells:  A1..A5 and B1..B5

The formulas may be as complicated as you want: 

SIN(A1)*COS(A2)/((1.2*A8)+LN(FACT(A8)+8.9E-3))+(C1>C5)

To edit an existing formula or text simply move to the cell and
press ESC, make your changes and press <RETURN>. If you make
a mistake you may press ESC again, the old value of the cell will
then be restored.

To try MicroCalc now you may use the /L command and load the file:
CALCDEMO.
